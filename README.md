### Site Scope :

*The following must be incorporated:*
* Easy and intuitive to navigate.
* Carousel image with text sliders for Chobe National Park and the Okavango Delta.
* A responsive design that will present information in a logical format on all devices.
* Apropriate branding and color palette
* A geolocated map on the home screen showing the Okavango Delta and Chobe National park.

### Structure Plane :

Each page has the same structure :
* The logo is on the left and the navigation bar in the center.
* The main body of the page contains the relevant information.
* Footer at the bottom of the page containg social media links and copyright text.


### Skeleton Plane :
I started with a **pen and paper to draw my wireframes,** but ultimately were created using **Figma.** Each page of the application was rendered as a wireframe in **diffrent screen sizes** to show how elements per page would react to different viewport sizes. Each element put down on this stage has made it into the **physical development** of the application with slight changes occuring from the original wireframes.

* [home](wireframe/wireframes1-sketch.jpg)
* [places to explore](wireframe/wireframes2-sketch.jpg)

Mobile:
* [home](wireframe/mobile-home.jpg)
* [places to explore](wireframe/mobile-explore.jpg)

Tablet:

* [places to expore](wireframe/tablet-explore.jpg)

### Surface Plane :
---


## Logo ##
To create a logo that scaled well across all devices I create the logo using **Online Logo generator**.

![logo](assets/images/logo_200x200_1.png)

To design this website I first visited the [Chobe National Park](https://chobenationalpark.co.za/)
and the [Botswana Tourism](https://www.botswanatourism.co.bw/explore/chobe-national-park) to take some ideas from the design, customize and flash them out with my personolized ideas.


## Fonts ##
I choose to use **Roboto fonts** through out the  entire website alongside with **Sans Serief** as a fall back. If by any means Roboto fails to load, Sans Serief will load to back up the Roboto font. The font is clear and easy on the eyes.


## Color Scheme ##
Taking into consideration the colors that came with the logo, I decided to use them as the main colors for my website.

![color scheme](assets/images/README-images/color.png)

The site has plenty of bright, colorful images, video and maps. I wanted to keep it nice and simple. I added a litle bit of color on the navigation bar and the footer. The navigation bar has a **hex color #2f2f29**, favicon and footer **hex #6c631a**. The word **Botswana Safaris**
on the favicon and social links I used a background color of **Orage** and **white** on the navigation links.
 The main color scheme used is the **default white color**.

 
 ## Icons ##
 **Icons** used are from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/), and are **self explanatory**.

 ## Images ##
 * The images used for banners and wildlife images were collected from [pixabaya](https://pixabay.com/).
 * Images for slide shows were collected from [pexels.](https://www.pexels.com/)


## Features
---
The website uses the same basic layout for each page. Each page has a responsive naviagtion bar with a logo placed on the left. Each page has a footer wih a copyright information and social media icons. The site is responsive to all screen sizes, this was achieved using Bootsrap  grid sysytem and css media queries.

Each page has its own image at the top. The home page having slider images about the Okavango Delta and the Chobe National Park. On the other hand, the Okavango Delta and Chobe National Park pages, each features a banner image to grab the user's attention.

#### Home ####
The home page features an **image carousel sliders** showing five different images with text one after another with fade effects. The main purpose of this carousel sliders is to make an impact when the user arrives on the site.

The user can click on the arrows on the side of the image to go to the next slider or to go to the previous slider. The user can also click the **carousel indicators** instead of the arrows.

 The video keep the user engaged and to show the user a litle bit about the Okavango Delta and the chobe National Park in Botswana. The user can choose to fast forward, pause or watch the video in full screen.


#### Places to exlpore ####
The places to explore page has two images. One for **Okavango Delta** and the other one for **Chobe National Park.** This would be the curious section of the site the user cant wait to see. 

When the user mouse over the Okavango Delta it *display animation and text,* on the other hand the *Chobe National Park diplays none.* The text is to give the user a glimpse about the Okavango Delta. When the user mouse out of the image the animation fades away.

Below ecah image is a bold link. Below the Chobe National park image, the user can see a bold link, underneath that, is the introductory text about the Chobe National Park. When the user hit the link *Chobe National Park* it takes the user to the main page of the Chobe National Park.


#### Contact Us ####
This section features a simple form for the user to get in touch with the site administration. The form request for client first name, last name, email addressand benearth that is a box to leave a message.

## Responsiveness of the website ##
---

* Chrome Developer tools and AM I Reponsive was used to test the responsiveness of the webiste on different device screen sizes.

NOTE:

* I noticed that on Iphone 375 text on the carousel slider image 1 and 2 is being pushed to the top of the naviagtion bar which lead to difficulties in reading.

* The same issue is present agin in Iphone S/5E

![](assets/images/responsive-images/responsive1.jpg)

## Browser Compatability ##

![](assets/images/responsive-images/responsive3.jpg)

* The website is compatable on most browsers. 

* This was tested on Chrome, Opera, Firefox and Microsoft edge browsers.

*I noticed that on Iphone 375 text on the carousel slider image 1 and 2 is being pushed to the top of the naviagtion bar which lead to difficulties in reading.



## Bugs Discovered: ##
* The main issue I faced was when implementing the maps as I had to show all the coordinates of restaurants, game reserve and accommodation.

* The coordinates found on the web were not exactly available in Google maps. I did multiple rounds of coordinate verification, and adjusted the zoom size of map accordingly for a better view.

* I also faced a challenge to fix some of the bugs in css which were related to responsiveness and carousel slider text. 

* To fix the responsiveness I added some breakpoints on certain parts.


### JSHint ###

[JShint](https://jshint.com/) was used to validate the JavaScript code for semantic and syntax errors. No warnings or error were found.
The results are positive and the code is valid.
