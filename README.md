# Explore Botswana Safaris #

[View deployed site here]()

 Safaris in Botswana is a website designed for **tourists and individuals** who want to visit **safaris in Botswana** to view a variety of wildlife in their natural habitat, take part in adventurous outdoor activities and discover the real Africa. Botswana is a land of sweeping spaces where wetlands thrive and wildlife abounds. Venture into **two of the country’s most treasured wilderness areas** to discover an astounding array of flora and fauna on a variety of excursions.

 In **the northern corner** of Botswana near Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe border is the **Chobe National Park.** The home to one of the world’s largest concentrations of elephants, observe wildlife such as elephants, lions, and wild dogs on game drives and river cruises,  with the Chobe River running through the heart of the park. It is a great place to spot the wildlife.

 Then experience the **World Heritage-listed Okavango Delta** from two different perspectives: on safari in a remote private concession and exploring the lush heart of the delta by dugout canoe and boat.

#### Wireframes: ###

I started with a **pen and paper to draw my wireframes,** but ultimately were created using **Figma.** Each page of the application was rendered as a wireframe in **diffrent screen sizes** to show how elements per page would react to different viewport sizes. Each element put down on this stage has made it into the **physical development** of the application with slight changes occuring from the original wireframes.

### Design ###

To design this website I first visited the [Chobe National Park](https://chobenationalpark.co.za/)
and the [Botswana Tourism](https://www.botswanatourism.co.bw/explore/chobe-national-park) to take some ideas from the design, customize and flash them out with my personolized ideas.
