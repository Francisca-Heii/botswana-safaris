### Structure Plane :
*The site can be used on Mobile, Tablet or desktop, it was designed on mobile first approch.*

Each page has the same structure :
* The logo is on the left and the navigation bar in the center.
* The main body of the page contains the relevant information.
* Footer at the bottom of the page containg social media links and copyright text.


### Skeleton Plane :
I started with a **pen and paper to draw my wireframes,** but ultimately were created using **Figma.** Each page of the application was rendered as a wireframe in **diffrent screen sizes** to show how elements per page would react to different viewport sizes. Each element put down on this stage has made it into the **physical development** of the application with slight changes occuring from the original wireframes.

### Surface Plane :

## Logo ##
To create a logo that scaled well across all devices I create the logo using **Online Logo generator**.

![logo](assets/images/logo_200x200_1.png)

To design this website I first visited the [Chobe National Park](https://chobenationalpark.co.za/)
and the [Botswana Tourism](https://www.botswanatourism.co.bw/explore/chobe-national-park) to take some ideas from the design, customize and flash them out with my personolized ideas.


## Fonts ##
I choose to use **Roboto fonts** through out the  entire website alongside with **Sans Serief** as a fall back. If by any means Roboto fails to load, Sans Serief will load to back up the Roboto font. The font is clear and easy on the eyes.


## Color Scheme ##
Taking into consideration the colors that came with the logo, I decided to use them as the main colors for my website.

![color scheme](README-images/color.png)


The site has plenty of bright, colorful images, video and maps. I wanted to keep it nice and simple. I added a litle bit of color on the navigation bar and the footer. The navigation bar has a **hex color #2f2f29**, favicon and footer **hex #6c631a**. The word **Botswana Safaris**
on the favicon and social links I used a background color of **Orage** and **white** on the navigation links.
 The main color scheme used is the **default white color**

 ## Logo ##
 

 ## Icons ##
 **Icons** used are from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/), and are **self explanatory**.
